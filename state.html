    <p class="dText">
        Khartoum State, located in Sudan, has a rich history that dates back centuries. It is named after its capital city, Khartoum, which is situated at the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile rivers. The area has been inhabited since ancient times and has been a significant trading and administrative center throughout history.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the 20th century, Sudan gained independence from British and Egyptian colonial rule in 1956. Khartoum has since served as the political and economic center of Sudan. However, the country experienced significant political instability and conflict over the years, including the lengthy Sudanese Civil War and the secession of South Sudan in 2011.
        Khartoum State has witnessed significant development and urbanization, becoming the most populous and important state in Sudan. It remains a key hub for trade, culture, and administration, playing a central role in Sudan's history and development.
